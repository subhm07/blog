title: Welcome To Basic Of Doom-Emacs!
---

Doom is a configuration framework for GNU Emacs tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite operating system.

I use Athena OS based on arch which is basically known for Redteam and Blueteam training preinstalled tools with themed windows manager like Bspwn, Xfce, Gnome etc.
I've faced many issues with hanging around terminals and windows manager for my custom pentesting purposes, I heard about emacs and doom emacs after 6years using vim and nano. I'll share my experience of using doom emacs and Lets me show some basics first :
